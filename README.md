## Overview
This project aims to predict flight prices using various machine learning algorithms. We begin by exploring and analyzing flight data to extract meaningful insights. Key steps include data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation using different algorithms such as Linear Regression and Random Forests.

## Requirements
- To run this project locally, ensure you have Python (version 3.12.2) installed.
- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/junperes/Flight-Price-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning-Models.git`
- Install the required libraries using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Technologies Used

- **Python Libraries:**
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy` for numerical operations and array manipulation.
  - `seaborn` for statistical data visualization.
  - `matplotlib` for creating plots and charts.
  - `scipy.stats.randint` for generating random integers.

- **Machine Learning Libraries:**
  - `scikit-learn`:
    - `LinearRegression` for fitting a linear regression model.
    - `StandardScaler` for standardizing features.
    - `train_test_split` for splitting data into training and testing sets.
    - `RandomizedSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning using random search.
    - `RandomForestRegressor` for fitting a random forest regression model.
    - Evaluation metrics: `mean_absolute_error`, `mean_squared_error`, `r2_score`.

## Take a Quick Look at the Data Structure
In this section, we explore the dataset used for predicting flight prices,  sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction).

The data_exploration.ipynb notebook provides an overview of the dataset, including data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and visualizations. Key steps involve handling missing values, summarizing features, and exploring feature relationships through plots and correlation matrices to prepare the data for further analysis.
